A JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code.

The first JavaScript engines were mere **interpreters**, but all relevant modern engines use **just-in-time compilation** for improved performance.

**V8** from Google is the most used JavaScript engine. **Google Chrome** and the many other Chromium-based browsers use it, as do applications built with **CEF**, **Electron**, or any other framework that embeds Chromium. Other uses include the Node.js and Deno runtime systems.

**SpiderMonkey** is developed by Mozilla for use in Firefox and its forks. The GNOME Shell uses it for extension support.

**JavaScriptCore** is Apple's engine for its Safari browser. Other WebKit-based browsers and the Bun runtime system also use it. KJS from KDE was the starting point for its development.

**Chakra** is the engine of the Internet Explorer browser.

**Microsift Edge** earlier used **chakra**, was later rebuilt as a Chromium-based browser and thus now uses V8.
